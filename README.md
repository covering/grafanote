# grafanote
A combination of grafana and notebook to build free style internal system


# what can this do
1. with grafana, a quick dashboard system is launched.

2. with jupyter, a notebook is launched.

3. with a demo "apis" server in jupyter, the html/js code embeded in grafana html panel can do api calls!
   then, it is possible to build a customized dashboard with jquery(embeded in grafana), and some simple html/js code!
   every one could create a "component" in a panel, without React/nodejs/vue or any other complex "js framework".

   make front simple again.
